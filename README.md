# DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp

SpotApps are ThoughtSpotâ€™s out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They utilize ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

The DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp mimics the BambooHR or Workday data model. When deployed, it creates several Worksheets, Answers, and Liveboards based on your BambooHR or Workday data in your cloud data warehouse.

This is a sample Liveboard, created after you deploy the DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp:

Use the DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp to gain invaluable insight into your workforce diversity data from your HR application.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- **Review Required Data**: Examine the required tables and columns for the SpotApp.
- **Ensure Column Compatibility**: Make sure that your columns match the required column type listed in the schema for your SpotApp.
- **Sync Data**: Synchronize all tables and columns from BambooHR or Workday to your cloud data warehouse. ThoughtSpot recommends syncing all tables and columns to ensure comprehensive data availability.
- **Collaborate on Data Movement**: If using an ETL/ELT tool or working with another team, ensure all columns from the tables listed in the SpotApp are synchronized.
- **Obtain Credentials**: Acquire SYSADMIN privileges to connect to your cloud data warehouse, which must contain the data ThoughtSpot will use to create Answers, Liveboards, and Worksheets.
- **Unique Connection Name**: Each new SpotApp connection name must be unique.
- **Administrator Access**: Maintain administrator access to BambooHR or Workday.

Access to the following data is required, refer to the DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp schema for more details:
- BambooHR or Workday data

## Deploy the SpotApp

After you have downloaded the Zip file and verified its contents, follow these steps:

1. Log into your ThoughtSpot instance and create an Embrace connection to all of the relevant views.
2. Import the TML for the Worksheets and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
3. Import the TML for the Liveboards and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
4. You are ready to start searching your data!

For detailed instructions on how to import TML files, refer to the [ThoughtSpot documentation](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/software/latest/tml-import-export-multiple).


## After you deploy the DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp
After you deploy the DEI Workforce Diversity SpotApp, you must update the formulas in the Worksheet the SpotApp created with your specific information. Your department names may not match the exact names used in the formula for Functional Groups, for example, so you must replace the names in the formula with your own department names.

You must update the following formulas in the Employee Data Worksheet in ThoughtSpot:
- Employee Count(Full Time Employee)
- Functional Groups
- Level Buckets
- Level Groups
